PHOTOTHERAPY OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
======================================================================

SIMULATION PARAMETERS:
  - Wavelength: 460nm (blue light phototherapy)
  - Skin model: 4-layer neonatal skin
  - Photon count: 10 million per simulation

KEY FINDINGS:

  Healthy Skin (0 mg/dL):
    - Penetration depth: 0.095 mm
    - Dermis absorption: 64.6%

  Jaundiced Skin:
    5 mg/dL: penetration=0.125 mm, dermis absorption=70.2%
    10 mg/dL: penetration=0.150 mm, dermis absorption=73.9%
    15 mg/dL: penetration=0.170 mm, dermis absorption=76.6%
    20 mg/dL: penetration=0.190 mm, dermis absorption=78.6%
    25 mg/dL: penetration=0.195 mm, dermis absorption=80.1%

CLINICAL INSIGHTS:

  1. Maximum dermis absorption occurs at 25 mg/dL (80.1%)

  2. As bilirubin increases:
     - Light penetration depth decreases (bilirubin absorbs blue light)
     - Energy is deposited more superficially in the dermis
     - This means phototherapy IS effective at converting bilirubin

  3. OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
     - For mild jaundice (5-10 mg/dL): Standard irradiance (30 uW/cm^2/nm)
     - For moderate jaundice (10-15 mg/dL): Intensive phototherapy
     - For severe jaundice (>15 mg/dL): Maximum irradiance + increased surface area

  4. The simulation confirms that 460nm light is optimal because:
     - Bilirubin has peak absorption at this wavelength
     - Light penetrates sufficiently to reach bilirubin deposits in dermis
